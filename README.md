# Silent Auction Program

This is a simple Python-based console application for managing a silent auction. The program allows users to enter their bids and identifies the highest bidder at the end.

## Features
- Clears console for a clean interface using the `replit` module.
- Displays an auction logo.
- Allows multiple users to input their name and bid amount.
- Determines and announces the highest bidder.

## How It Works
1. Start: The program displays a logo.
2. User Input: Prompts users for their name and bid amount.
3. Clear Screen: Clears the console if there are more bidders.
4. End of Bidding: Calculates and displays the highest bid.

## Usage
Ensure you have the `replit` module and the `art` module for the logo. Run the script in a Python environment that supports console I/O.
